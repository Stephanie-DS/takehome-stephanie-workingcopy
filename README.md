# Hello! This is a brief readme for this take home challenge.

If you'd like to see the overall progress and explanation, please refer to the COLAB file in the main folder: reddit_code_challenge_pulford.ipynb.

All of the files in the supplemental folder are work that I did toward arriving at the full solution.

All main files were moved to a folder to make sure that the main directory of this file was clear and readable. 

Thank you and best wishes!
